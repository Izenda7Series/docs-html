KPI Report Parts
===========================

- A KPI report part consists of three different tile types each of which can be scaled and has properties that affect the content within the tile. 
- KPI Tiles are arranged relative to each other on an underlying grid, which is only visible in edit mode. 
- KPIs can have a background image and color and the report part size responds to the size of the underlying grid. 
- KPIs should be used to visualize simple numerical metrics with text and images to enhance them.
