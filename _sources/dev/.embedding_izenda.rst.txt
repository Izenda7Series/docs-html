Understanding the Starter Kits
=========================

Out kits are designed to demonstrate how to embed Izenda into web applications. Every kit display many of the same concepts (e.g. embedding the Izenda suite as a single page application) but each may showcase additional features more extensively (e.g. hidden filters). All publically available kits can be found at ‘https://github.com/Izenda7Series’_ .

First Steps
--------------

Installing a standalone instance of Izenda
````````````````````````````````````````````
Before diving into integrating Izenda, we recommend first installing a local instance of our standalone version of Izenda to gain a better understanding of Izenda concepts such as report management, upgrading procedures, and platform access restrictions.  For more information on installing a standalone instance of Izenda, please refer to our ‘.install’_

Installing an integrated instance of Izenda
````````````````````````````````````````````
Each starter kit is designed with a specific system architecture in mind and can be distinguished by their deployment mode. The deployment mode refers to how your security model interacts with the Izenda API. For more information on Izenda’s available deployment modes, please refer to our ‘understanding_the_three-tiered_architecture’_ guide.

Deployment Mode 0 (Standalone)
* Standalone Instance of Izenda
Deployment Mode 1 (Back End Standalone, Front End Integrated)
*	MVC5 Back End Standalone
*	Angular Kit
Deployment Mode 3 (Fully Integrated)
* MVC5 Kit
	* Installation Video
	* Understanding the MVC Kit
* HTML Kit
	* Installation Video
	* Customization Video

Embedding Izenda into You Application
----------------------------------------
After setting up our starter kit, your next goal will be to embed Izenda into your own application. Depending on your project goals, this may require you start from scratch or use a pre-existing application. In either case, the following
