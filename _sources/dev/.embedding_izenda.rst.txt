We have created several starter kits to demonstrate how to embed Izenda into web applications. Every kit displays many of the same concepts (e.g. embedding the Izenda suite as a single page application) but each may showcase additional features more extensively (e.g. hidden filters and rendering individual reports.). All publically available kits can be found at ‘https://github.com/Izenda7Series’_ .

First Steps
--------------

Installing a standalone instance of Izenda
````````````````````````````````````````````
Before diving into integration, we recommend to install a local instance of our standalone version of Izenda to gain a better understanding of Izenda concepts such as report management, upgrading procedures, and platform access restrictions.  For more information on installing a standalone instance of Izenda, please refer to our ‘install/.stand_alone_deployment’_ guide.

Each starter kit is designed with a specific system architecture in mind and can be distinguished by their deployment mode. The deployment mode refers to how your security model interacts with the Izenda API. For more information on Izenda’s available deployment modes, please refer to our ‘understanding_the_three-tiered_architecture’_ guide. Please note, these kits are for demonstration purposes and should not be used as a fully-integrated solution “as-is.” You can use the kit for reference or a baseline but please ensure that the security and customization necessary meet the standards of your company.

Embedding Izenda into You Application
----------------------------------------
After setting up our starter kit, your next goal will be to embed Izenda into your own application. Depending on your project goals, this may require you start from scratch or use a pre-existing application. In either case, the following
