Logging

Log files are not being created
--------------------------------------
This issue is due to the API site/instance not having enough permissions to create the logs folder and the actual log files. Please ensure that you have given 'WRITE' permissions to the API. When the API has sufficient permissions, it will create the logs folder, you do not have to do this manually.
