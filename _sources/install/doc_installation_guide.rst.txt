Installation Guide
==========================

The following outlines the steps to install Izenda's Stand Alone Portal.

Standalone Installation Options
--------------------------------
There are two main options when deploying a "vanilla" instnace of our standalone environment.
-  Installing Izenda's front end and back end as two separate sites
-  Installing Izenda's front end and back end as virtual directories/applications under a host site

The architectural goal, pre-installation preparations, and web server setup are the same for both deployment options.


Architectural Goal
------------------------

   A diagram of implementation

Pre-installation Preparations
------------------------------

The setup of Izenda requires a download of the latest version of the stand-alone front-end and the back-end and a proper web server setup. Izenda can be installed on a local machine on a Windows machine for testing purposes and is a best practice for ensuring permissions and performance can be validated locally prior to moving toward more embedded and integrated examples, but it is not recommended for live deployments.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Izenda Installation As Two Separate Sites
------------------------------------------

The most common testing scenario places the front-end and the back-end on two separate sites. Virtual Directories and Virtual Applications deployments are possible with additional configuration and are outlined in another section below.

#. Extract the Izenda Front-end and Back-end packages to 2 separate
   folders, preferably at C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Izenda\\App and
   C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Izenda\\API.
#. Izenda can be installed in multiple configurations: new website, new
   application to an existing website, or new virtual application under
   an existing website:

   -  New website

      #. Right-click the local connection and select Add Website...
      #. Name the website IzendaApp and accept the Application pool with
         the same name.
      #. Click the ellipsis (...) button to select the location of the
         extracted Izenda Front-end package
         (C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Izenda\\App).
      #. Skip the Connect as... and Test Settings... buttons for now,
         since permissions have not been set for Izenda package folders.
      #. The Port for Front-end is best kept at the default value of 80.
      #. Optionally enter the website address into host name box, but
         you will have to bind that address with the correct ip in
         "C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts" file.

             e.g. with website address www.acme.com and the ip
             127.0.0.1, the following line needs to be added in hosts
             file:
             ``127.0.0.1    www.acme.com``

      #. Click OK to create the website.

      .. _IIS_Add_Website:

      .. figure:: /_static/images/IIS_Add_Website.png
         :width: 439px

         New Website |br|

#. Install Izenda Back-end package similarly with a different port.

#. .. _IIS_Folder_Permissions:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/IIS_Folder_Permissions.png
      :align: right
      :width: 239px

      Folder Permissions

   Set folder permissions

   #. Right-click the newly-created website, application or virtual
      application and select Edit Permissions to open the folder
      properties.
   #. In Security tab, click Edit to open Permissions dialog box.
   #. Click Add then enter ``IUSR`` then click OK (for IIS 7 and above).

          For older IIS versions, use ``NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORKSERVICE``.

   #. Back in Permissions dialog box, tick the Modify check-box for
      IUSR.
   #. Click OK to close all dialogs. |br|
   #. Set similar permissions for the other package.
   #. Update the Back-end API url in Front-end package: |br|
      Edit the file ``App\izenda_config.js``, replace the default value "WebApiUrl" with the correct ip and port:
      ``"WebApiUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/",``
      
 This concludes the steps necessary to install Izenda using two separate websites. 
 Please refer to the following guides below: 
 - Troubleshooting & Verifying the Installation
 - Common Izenda Stand-alone Installation Issues
 - Editing the Configuration Files


----------------------------------------------------------------


Deploying Izenda as a Virtual Directory or Application
------------------------------------------------------
 Installing Izenda as a virtual directorys will mirror the steps taken required to deploy Izenda using two separate websites but additional modifications are necessary for the front end and back end to interact correctly together.


Initial Set Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Add your Front-end package to IIS as a virtual directory. (For the purpose of this tutorial we have given it the alias of IzendaFront)
*  Add your Back-end package but then convert it to an application. (For the purpose of this tutorial we have given it the alias of IzendaBack)

Within the UI Folder of your Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Edit the izenda\_config.js, point the BaseURL and the WebApiUrl to
   the virtual directory for your front/back-end respectively

   -  Target code:

      .. code-block:: text

         BaseUrl:"/<your Url here>/"

         WebApiUrl:"http://<Your API URL here>/api/"

   -  Example change:

      .. code-block:: text

         BaseUrl:"/IzendaFront/"

         WebApiUrl:"http://localhost:80/IzendaBack/api/"

#. Edit the index.html file and add the URL for the Virtual Directory as
   below, this should follow the ending </style> tag

   -  Target code:

      .. code-block:: html

         <script>
            window.IzendaPublicPath = '/<your Url here>/';
         </script>

   -  Example change:

      .. code-block:: html

         <script>
            window.IzendaPublicPath = '/IzendaFront/';
         </script>

#. Alter the location of the files in the index.html file to point to
   the new location:

   -  Target code:

      .. code-block:: html

          <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/<your Url here>/favicon.png">
          <link href="/<your Url here>/izenda-app.css?
             4676ff4fe0cdf3cd2bab" rel="stylesheet"></head>

          <body>
             <div class="container" id="izenda-root"></div>
             <script type="text/javascript" src="/<your Url here>/izenda-vendors.js?4676ff4fe0cdf3cd2bab"></script>
             <script type="text/javascript" src="/<your Url here>/izenda_app.js?4676ff4fe0cdf3cd2bab"></script>
          </body>

   -  Example change:

      .. code-block:: html

         <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/IzendaFront/favicon.png">
         <link href="/IzendaFront/izenda-app.css?
         4676ff4fe0cdf3cd2bab" rel="stylesheet"></head>

         <body>
            <div class="container" id="izenda-root"></div>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="/IzendaFront/izenda-vendors.js?4676ff4fe0cdf3cd2bab"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="/IzendaFront/izenda_app.js?4676ff4fe0cdf3cd2bab"></script>
         </body>

#. Update the web.config file in the UI folder

   -  Target code:

      .. code-block:: html

         <action type="Rewrite" url="/<your Url here>/" />

   -  Example change:

      .. code-block:: html

         <action type="Rewrite" url="/IzendaFront/" />

Within the API Folder of your Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Update the Web.config file

   -  Target code:

      .. code-block:: xml

          <httpHandlers>
             <add verb="*" type="Nancy.Hosting.Aspnet.NancyHttpRequestHandler" path="/<Your API URL here>/api/*" />
          </httpHandlers>

          <handlers>
             <add name="Nancy" verb="*" type="Nancy.Hosting.Aspnet.NancyHttpRequestHandler" path="/<Your API URL here>/api/*"/>
          </handlers>

   -  Example change:

      .. code-block:: xml

         <httpHandlers>
            <add verb="*" type="Nancy.Hosting.Aspnet.NancyHttpRequestHandler" path="/IzendaBack/api/*" />
         </httpHandlers>

         <handlers>
            <add name="Nancy" verb="*" type="Nancy.Hosting.Aspnet.NancyHttpRequestHandler" path="/IzendaBack/api/*"/>
         </handlers>

 This concludes the steps necessary to install Izenda using virtual directories/applications.
 Please refer to the following guides below: 
 - Troubleshooting & Verifying the Installation
 - Common Izenda Stand-alone Installation Issues
 - Editing the Configuration Files
 

Troubleshooting & Verifying the Installation
-------------------------------------------------------

*  To ensure that your API site is running correctly, navigate to http://YOUR_API_URL/api/404 (e.g. http://localhost:8080/api/404)

   If your API is installed correctly, you should see the graphic below:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/SuccessfulAPI.png
   
      Successful Connection to API displays a stylized 404 error

*  Navigate to the API folder, you should see a 'logs' folder with with at least one log file. If you do not see the folder and/or files, verify that the application pool and/or web site user have write permissions to the API folder.




Common Izenda Stand-alone Installation Issues
-------------------------------------------------------

*  IIS ASP.NET

   Izenda’s API is a .NET web application compatible with .NET 4.0 and higher.

   For .NET web applications to run through IIS you need to install IIS ASP.NET through your server’s Add Roles and Feature Wizard, or through the `IIS Web Platform Installer <https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx>`__.

   *  `Add Web Server Role and .NET Framework`_
   *  `Install ASP.NET 4.5 and URL Rewrite Components`_

   |br|

   Without these features installed you may encounter errors like the following:

   .. container:: bold red

      HTTP Error 500.xx – Internal Server Error

   .. container:: bold

      The requested page cannot be accessed because the related configuration data for the page is invalid.

   |br|

*  IIS URL Rewrite Module

   Izenda’s Stand-alone UI web.config makes use of the IIS URL Rewrite Module for routing.

   You’ll install this module through the `IIS Web Platform Installer <https://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx>`__.

   *  `Install ASP.NET 4.5 and URL Rewrite Components`_

   |br|

   Without this feature installed you may encounter errors like the following navigating to the UI.

   .. container:: bold red

      Configuration Error

   .. container:: bold

      An error occurred during the processing of a configuration file required to service this request.

   |br|

*  Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable for Izenda’s Oracle Drivers

   Izenda’s Oracle Drivers utilize the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable.

   These can be installed by downloading the installer from Microsoft: |br|
   `Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x64) <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632>`__

   Without this dependency installed you may encounter errors like the following.

   .. container:: bold red

      Could load file or assembly ‘Oracle.ManagedDataAccess’ or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format.

   .. container:: bold

      An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request.

   |br|

*  Mixing Two Separate Application Installation Steps with Virtual Directory Installation Steps

   There are two different ways to install Izenda Stand-alone, as two separate applications with distinct ports or domains, or as one application with a virtual directory. 

   Concepts from these two separate installation options cannot be mixed together without creating issues. Make sure to follow just one guide or the other:

   *  `Izenda Installation as Two Separate Sites`_
   *  `Deploying Izenda as a Virtual Directory or Application`_

   |br|

   Once you have followed one set of instructions to completion, you can move on to `Troubleshooting & Verifying the Installation`_ guides, and :doc:`Install Izenda System Database and Apply License </ui/doc_system_db_and_license>` guides.

   |br|

*  The izenda_config.js file

   You’ll need to edit the izenda_config.js file during installation and it’s important to use fully qualified URLs for the WebApiURL.

   For example, a fully qualified URL to the API should include ``http://`` at the beginning and ``/api/`` at the end. It should look something like what you see below. For `Izenda Installation as Two Separate Sites`_ this is all you need to edit. |br|
   ``WebApiUrl:"http://192.168.45.37:8200/api/"``

   For `Deploying Izenda as a Virtual Directory or Application`_ you need to edit the BaseUrl. This should look like the following, per the instructions with the trailing slash. |br|
   ``BaseUrl:”/IzendaDirectory/”``

   If you don’t properly configure this file you may be able to see the Izenda login UI, but not get directed to the setup UI, or you may see many console errors in your browser’s dev tools.

   |br|

*  API Directory Permissions

   If you can get Izenda running and see the UI, but get an error after setting your Izenda Configuration Database Connection String, you may be encountering permission issues at the API level.

   Izenda’s API needs proper write permissions to its own directory to create the izendadb.config file and generate log files.

   Often there are issues using just the default IUSR or NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORKSERVICE roles to provide these permissions.

   Try the following to get past the issue:

   *  Give the IIS Application Pool Full Access to the API directory.

      You can see the API’s Application Pool name just by looking at the application’s basic settings in IIS.

      .. figure:: /_static/images/install_IIS_basic_settings.png
         :width: 395px

         IIS basic settings |br|

      You can then use that name in setting your folder permissions as you see below. |br| 
      ``IIS AppPool\YouApplicationPoolName``

      .. figure:: /_static/images/install_IIS_AppPool_name.png
         :width: 344px

         IIS Select Application Pool name |br|

      After giving this IIS Application Pool Full Access rights, you can restart the API, and try using the UI again.

   *  If that doesn’t work, you can try the ‘nuclear option’ and add **Everyone** with Full Access rights, restart the API, and try using the UI again.

   |br|

*  Misconfigured Connection Strings or Difficulty Connecting

   Izenda supports many different database types, and has specific drivers for these specific database types.

   -  Make sure you’ve selected the right Data Server Type in the dropdowns near Connection String UIs.

      .. figure:: /_static/images/install_select_data_server_type.png
         :width: 900px

         Select Data Server Type |br|

   -  Make sure you’ve used the proper syntax for your Connection String.

      MSSQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MySQL Connection Strings are all formatted a little different, provide different options, and expect different syntaxes. Use resources like `ConnectionStrings.com <https://www.connectionstrings.com/>`__ to make sure you’re including the right details, options, and port numbers:

      + MSSQL
      + PostgreSQL
      + Oracle
      + MySQL

      |br|

   -  Make sure you’ve allowed the connection through your Network Security.

      If you use custom ports for your database you’ll need to factor that into both the web server running Izenda as well as your Connection String.

      If you use Azure or AWS you may need to add the web server running Izenda to your Network Security Groups, or whitelist the IP address so that it can connect to your database.

      |br|

   -  Make sure you’ve given your Connection String user proper permissions.

      Double check that the connection string user has permissions to the databases and schemas you want to connect to. You’ll need to give read/write permissions to the user for the Izenda Configuration Database. Izenda cannot get around your RDBMS security, as you might expect. 

      |br|

   -  Try connecting with another tool or application.

      If you’re continuing to have issues with a Connection String you may want to ensure that it’s an Izenda specific problem before reaching out.

      Try using your RDBMS management tools to connect to the database with the same user, and preferably from the same server, that you are trying to connect with using Izenda.

   |br|

*  Understanding the Izenda Configuration Database Connection String

   The Izenda Configuration Database Connection String and Reporting Data Source Connection Strings are set in two different places, it totally separate UIs or underlying APIs.

   -  Izenda Configuration Database Connection String

      The Izenda Configuration Database Connection String will be set in the Settings page under the System DB & License tab. 

      Be very careful when setting and/or changing this connection string!

      This connection string will point Izenda to a database where it can create its schema and store report metadata, dashboard metadata, data model metadata, Tenant, Role, and User metadata, and much more.

      If you set this to an existing database you will end up with Izenda specific tables in your schema, it’s usually best to use a separate empty database for the Izenda Configuration Database unless you’re comfortable with mixing Izenda’s storage schema with your database schema.

      |br|

   -  Reporting Data Source Connection Strings

      Reporting Data Source Connection Strings will be set in the Settings page under the Data Setup/Connection String tab. 

      After connecting Izenda will query the database to establish the available data source listing, so that you can choose specific objects to move into the visible data sources. 

      These selected objects can then be further modeled upon, aliased, secured, and exposed to end-users within report designers.

      Do not delete Connection Strings if you simply need to change connection strings to another database with a similar schema, or if you need to add new objects to the available/visible data source lists, you can change/rebuild Connection Strings or press reconnect and refresh the schema.

      Deleting and recreating Connection Strings will break your reports and dashboards, where just resetting the Connection Strings or reconnecting generally will not.

   |br|

*  In build 1.23.0, an exception may occur after creating an APP and API websites. If you receive  an error akin to the following:

   .. code-block:: text
   
      Exception type: ConfigurationErrorsException
      Exception message: Could not load file or assembly 'Oracle.ManagedDataAccessDTC.DLL' or one of its dependencies. The specified module could not be found.

   Then remove Oracle.ManagedDataAccessDTC.DLL from your API/bin/ folder and place it in a separate location. If the problem persists, place the file back in the API/bin/ folder.

Editing the Configuration Files
--------------------------------

Additional features can be set for a customized deployment experience. For live sites, several of the features below are recommended.

-  Change the Back-end passphrase, which is the key to encrypt and
   decrypt data in Izenda.

       Enter a 29-character value into the value of this key:
       ``<appSettings>``, ``<add key="izedapassphrase" value="" />``

.. warning::

   This passphrase cannot be changed afterwards since already encrypted data cannot be decrypted with another passphrase.

-  Recommended: add :ref:`security
   configurations <Web_Server_Security_Configurations>`

-  Optionally change the default Back-end path ``/api/``

       e.g. change the path to ``/rest/``

   #. Edit the file ``API\Web.config``, replace the default value "api"
      with the new value at the following places:

      -  ``<appSettings>``, ``<add key="izedaapiprefix" value="api" />``
      -  ``<system.web>``, ``<httpHandlers>``,
         ``<add verb="*" type="Nancy.Hosting.Aspnet.NancyHttpRequestHandler" path="api/*" />``
      -  ``<system.webServer>``, ``<handlers>``,
         ``<add name="Nancy" verb="*" type="Nancy.Hosting.Aspnet.NancyHttpRequestHandler" path="api/*" />``

   #. Also edit the file ``App\izenda_config.js``, replace the default
      value "api" with the new value at the following places:

      -  ``"WebApiUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/",``

-  Optionally change Izenda log file settings

   -  Change the default log file location in ``<log4net ..>``,
      ``<appender name="RollingFileAppender" ..>``,
      ``<file value="logs\izenda-log.log" />``, which resolves to
      C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Izenda\\API\\logs in a typical installation.
   -  Change how the log files are archived/rotated/rolled in
      ``<log4net ..>``, ``<appender name="RollingFileAppender" ..>``.

          The default setting is to keep maximum 1000 last files of 5MB
          each every day. See other examples at `log4net
          document <https://logging.apache.org/log4net/release/config-examples.html#rollingfileappender>`__.

   -  Enable folder compression: log file content is all text and will
      compress up to 2% of the original size.

      #. Right-click on the folder
         (C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\Izenda\\API\\logs) and click Properties.
      #. Click Advanced button in General tab.
      #. Tick Compress contents to save disk space check-box, then click
