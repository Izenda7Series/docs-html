Understanding The Tenant-Role-User Relationship
================================================

-------------------------
Tenants, Roles, and Users
-------------------------

Within Izenda, users fit into categories that define their relationships
with other users. Izenda utilizes these relationships to define access
rights of features, data, reports, and dashboards.

   Tenant-Role-User Relationship

Users
-----

A user is the elemental classification of an entity within Izenda.

-  Users have a user name and token to grant access to various parts of
   Izenda
-  A user does not have to have a defined tenant or a defined role

   -  A user either has a tenant/role or the user is a System
      Administrator. Within your User Setup, you will able to toggle a
      user to be an Administrator.
   -  System Administrators can impersonate tenant views to navigate the
      platform with a tenant's access.
- A user can belong to more than one role

For more on User Setup, please see the :doc:`/ui/doc_user_setup`.


Roles
-----

A role is a classification within a tenant and are used to define
natural distinctions between users. For instance, your company man have
an IT Department that is interested in bug reports and a Sales
Department that is interested in quarterly sales. Roles will allow you
to filter the data available for each role so that they only see
relevant information.
- Roles can overlap each other but roles cannot be subsets of each other


For more on Role Setup, please see the :doc:`/ui/doc_role_setup`.

Tenants
-------

Tenants are the largest user classification available. A tenant is
generally used to define one definite entity with a broad access to
features, data, reports, and dashboards.
- Users and roles can only belong to 1 tenant

Tenant System Modes
-------------------

-  Izenda is built to support two main system configuration modes:

Single Tenant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Single tenant allows you to set up Izenda for a single client scenario.

   Single Tenant Mode


Multi-Tenant
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Multi-Tenant provides an easy management of multiple clients on the same instance of Izenda.

-  If you use multi-tenant mode, you can choose to allow duplicated User IDs where an ID can be used in multiple tenants. These User IDs do not reference the same user.
-  Roles can mirror each other in each tenant but roles cannot exist between tenants.
-  Users can mirror each other in each tenant but users, other than a System Administrator, cannot exist between tenants.
