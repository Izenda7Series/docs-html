User Setup
==========================

The **User Setup** page allows user to manage users.

.. note::

   When in integrated mode (DeploymentMode <> 0) adding and removing Users from the UI is not available. This is to ensure the host  applicaton and Izenda stay in sync. API's must be used for these functions in integrated environments. For more information on the API's please review the documentation 
   `here <https://www.izenda.com/docs/ref/api_user.html?highlight=user integration saveuser#post-user-integration-saveuser>`_.

      Add a User

#. Enter a unique user id, then the first name and last name.
#. An email address is not required, but is recommended for password
   retrieval and report subscriptions.
#. Select roles from the drop-down.
#. Enter the time zone adjustments into Data Offset and Time Offset
   boxes.

   -  Data Offset: the time shift to be applied to datetime data from
      client database connections to match user's local time zone.
      **As of v2.9.5 offset will accept partial hours as .25, .5, .75**

          For example, the data from client database connections are in
          Estern Time "UTC-05:00" and the user being created is in
          Central Time "UTC-06:00", then the value "-1" hour should be
          entered into Data Offset. (It is easiest to use an online time
          zone converter to find out this value)

   -  Timestamp Offset: the time shift to be applied to timestamp data
      (created date time, last updated date time) from UTC to match user's local time zone.
      **As of v2.9.5 offset will accept partial hours as .25, .5, .75**

          For example, current UTC time is "02:00" the user being created is in Central Time
          "UTC-05:00", then the value "-5" hours should be entered
          into Timestamp Offset. (It is easiest to use an online time
          zone converter to find out this value)
