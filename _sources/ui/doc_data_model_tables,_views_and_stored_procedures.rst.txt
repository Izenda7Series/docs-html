The **Data Model/Tables**, **Data Model/Views** and **Data Model/Stored Procedures** pages allow user to

-  manage tables, views, their columns and relationships
-  add and remove calculated fields
-  manage stored procedures, their parameters, output columns and
   relationships
-  assign filter values for stored procedure parameters
-  mark stored procedures as dynamic

Add a calculated field to table or view
---------------------------------------

.. topic:: Calculated field

   Calculated field is a virtual field calculated from an expression that can use other fields in the same table or view. A calculated field is created to simplify the select queries by hiding the detailed formula, and the formula can be replaced without any change in existing queries. A calculated field will also avoid data redundancy since it is re-calculated in each query.

   For example, from a student test score, the grade can be calculated by this formula:

   .. code-block:: sql

      WHEN score >= 0 AND score < 7 THEN 'GOOD'
      WHEN score >= 7 AND score < 9 THEN 'EXCELLENT'
      WHEN score >= 9               THEN 'OUTSTANDING'

   If defined as a calculated field, the grade can later use another formula without changing any queries.

#. Click Save at the top.

Set stored procedure as dynamic
-------------------------------

For stored procedures with any input parameter, they can be set as
dynamic.

.. topic:: Dynamic stored procedure

   A stored procedure with one (or more) input parameter might have different output schemas based on the value of that input parameter. The reports have 2 options to handle this situation:

   * Dynamic: The schema is only determined at report design time by a user-supplied input value.
      The schema is empty in Data Model.
   * Non-dynamic: The schema is assumed to remain consistent regardless of the input value.
      System can try getting that schema for Data Model by executing with null input parameters. In case it cannot because any parameter requires NOT NULL, user will be prompted for a proper input value.

      The exact rule for NOT NULL input parameters:

      #. If Filter Value has been defined for a parameter, the first value in that list will be used as input value.
      #. If not, then null will be used as input value.

   Non-dynamic should be the default value since in practice, well-coded stored procedures should return a consistent schema.

      Data Model - Set stored procedure as dynamic confirmation

   Tick the Dynamic check-box to set a stored procedure as dynamic.
#. Click OK in the confirmation pop-up. (:numref:`Data_Model_SP_Set_Dynamic_Confirmation`)
#. Click Save button at the top, then click OK in the confirmation
   pop-up.
#. The stored procedure will be set as dynamic and its schema will be
   removed from the lower Column Grid. The Execute button is also
   disabled. |br|

Set stored procedure as non-dynamic
-----------------------------------

#. Untick the Dynamic check-box to set a stored procedure as
   non-dynamic.
#. Click Save button at the top, then click OK in the confirmation
   pop-up.
#. The stored procedure will be set as non-dynamic. The Execute button
   is also enabled for user to get the schema.

Execute a non-dynamic stored procedure to get the schema
--------------------------------------------------------

#. Click the Execute button above the lower Column Grid.
#. System tries running the stored procedure to get the schema.
#. The schema will be populated into the lower Column Grid.
#. Click Save button at the top, then click OK in the confirmation
   pop-up.

The action will fail if one of the parameters requires not null and
Filter Value has not been defined.

In this case, please update the Filter Value section.

Update Filter Value for a stored procedure parameter
----------------------------------------------------

#. Click the icon in Filter Value box.

       Filter Value icon only appears for parameters.

#. Select either Filter Lookup Key - Value or User Defined Filter Value

   -  Example to set
      parameter @OrderID to look up from NorthwindA.dbo.Orders.OrderID,
      displaying column ShipName to end-user. (:numref:`Data_Model_SP_Filter_Lookup_Key_-_Value`)
