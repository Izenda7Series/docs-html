Overview
--------

In the report designer, each report part has an associated menu that
can be accessed by hovering over the report part near the top. The menu
looks like what is displayed below:

.. note::

   Collapsing the preview mode will suspend database calls until the user expands it or flips the tile

Menu Options in Report Designer 
-------------------------------

Below is a list of the available options:

-  Full Screen -- Takes the report part into a full screen mode
   effectively hiding the Filter tab, but offering more room for design
   or viewing purposes.

-  Copy -- Creates an identical copy of a report part. Makes it easier
   to add additional report parts with the same data structure and format
   to be edited quickly.

-  Switch to Configuration/Preview Mode -- The method of switching from
   previewing a report part in the design real estate of the report and the
   actual underlying configuration of the report part itself. This flipping
   mechanism can also be found on the Dashboard module of Izenda as each
   report part can be individually flipped and manipulated through this
   same functionality.

   .. figure:: /_static/images/ReportPartMenuConfiguartion.png

      Clicking this button will flip the report part back to the report
      design real estate

-  Delete -- Removes a report part from the report. This will fully
   remove the report part from the definition of the report. There is no
   way to undo this action.

   .. figure:: /_static/images/ReportPartMenuDelete.png

      Clicking this button will delete the selected report part
