   #. Add [OrderID] to Columns box, then choose Count as the Function,
      it should show up as Count(OrderID).
   #. The result should be multiple grids, each for a specific country
      and region (:numref:`NW_Orders_Grid_Separators_ShipCountry,_ShipRegion_Group_by_ShipCity_Count_OrderID`). |br|
   #. Select a different

   .. figure:: /_static/images/NW_Orders_Order_Count_by_OrderYear_ShipCountry_ShipCity.png
      :align: right
      :width: 387px

      Order Count by OrderYear, ShipCountry and ShipCity

   The
   pivot grid styles must used when all the label values depend on the
   actual data (not predetermined). For example, this report with all
   the header values calculated from the data (OrderDate) must use the
   pivot style. |br|

-  .. _NW_Suppliers_Drill-down_Preview:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/NW_Suppliers_Drill-down_Preview.png
      :align: right
      :width: 341px

      Supplier Count by Country, Region and City

   The
   drill-down grid style must be used for the need to expand and
   collapse groups of values to see the detailed or summarized numbers.
   For example, this report with the number of suppliers per city then
   per country must use the drill-down style. |br|

-  .. _List_of_US_States_and_Territories_by_Population:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/List_of_US_States_and_Territories_by_Population.png
      :align: right
      :width: 488px

      List of US States and Territories by Population

   The
   vertical and horizontal styles are used when some label values are
   already determined at design time. And horizontal style should be
   used when the list of label values is expectedly longer than the
   number of columns. For example: the list of US States and Territories
   by Population in :numref:`List_of_US_States_and_Territories_by_Population`. |br|
