      -  dashboards
      -  reports
      -  tenant permissions
      -  role names

Rename a Workspace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. .. _Workspace_Rename_Duplication:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/Workspace_Rename_Duplication.png
      :align: right
      :width: 211px

      Rename a Workspace

   Click the pencil icon to rename the workspace.
#. Enter a new name for the workspace.
#. Click the check icon to confirm the new name.
#. The name will be checked for duplication. |br|

Items to Copy Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section lists selectable items to copy:

-  Data Model
-  Advanced Data Settings
-  Tenant Permissions
-  Roles
-  Role Permissions

Configure Source Data Model Copy List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Source panel on the left shows visible database connections, schemas
together with visible inner data model items.

   Tick the checkbox next to each item to include it in the Data Model copy operation.

Destination panel on the right is the list of selected tenants to copy
to, together with validation and authentication status.

Configure Destination Tenant List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Click the down arrow in Destination box to see the list of tenants.
#. Click each tenant to add it to the box.
#. Click the down arrow again to close the list.

.. note::

   To copy to all tenants, simply select "All Tenants" option. It will replace all currently selected tenants when selected.

Edit mappings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mapping specifies the physical destination for each database
connection or schema of tenant (in case the database connection or
schema name in destination is different from logical data model).

#. Select a database connection in Source.
#. Choose the mapping type: Database or Schema.
#. -  Select a schema from the Object list if using Schema mapping.
   -  For Database mapping, the Object list is already populated with
      the database name.
#. Select the target database connection.
#. -  Enter the schema name (expression) into Object list if using
      Schema mapping.
   -  For Database mapping, the Object list is already populated with
      the database name.
#. Select the tenants to apply this mapping to.
#. Continue to add mappings to cover all selected database connections,
   schemas and tenants.

Rules:

-  Tenants without a Database mapping will be copied to the same
   database connection.
-  Each schema without mapping will be copied to a schema with the same
   name (in the database connection specified in mapping).

For example, user needs to copy data model for schema Sales to Tenant01, Tenant02 and Tenant03.

    The schemas are named Sales0x with x = 1, 2 or 3 for each tenant
    respectively.

    Tenant02 and Tenant03 share the same physical database TenantDB
    while Tenant03 uses ACMEDB database on a separate server.

Following is how to configure the workspace:

#. Tick Data Model check-box in Items to Copy section.
#. .. _Copy_Management_Sample_Sales_schema:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/Copy_Management_Sample_Sales_schema.png
      :align: right
      :width: 664px

      Copy Sales schema

   Tick the Sales schema to include it in the copy. |br|
#. Select Tenant01, Tenant02 and Tenant03 as Destinations.
#. Add Connection to TenantDB for Tenant02 and Tenant03, and add connection to ACMEDB for Tenant03.
#. Add the mappings.

   .. _Copy_Management_Sample_Mapping:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/Copy_Management_Sample_Mapping.png

      Map database connections and schemas |br|

Validate Consistency between Source and Destinations
----------------------------------------------------

#. Click the Validate button at the top to validate for tenants with
   status "Need validated":

       Each tenant will be checked for a valid mapping for each schema.

#. Click the gear icon (âš™) next to
   each tenant to open Advanced Settings page for that tenant.
#. Click Validate button at the top to validate consistency in data
   model between source and the selected tenant.

       Selected objects in source will be checked for existence in data
       model for selected tenant by name.

#. Click OK to close the page.
