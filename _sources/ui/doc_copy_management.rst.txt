Items to Copy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each item to copy can have its own settings, which are displayed under Main Panel in a Workspace.

This section lists selectable items to copy:

-  Only Settings :red:`*`

       allows user to pick specific tenant to copy from.

       This special item was introduced to emulate the template mode for tenants. A distinctive feature of this item is that user does not need to select specific connectors, roles, etc. and all setting from Source tenant will be copied, even new ones that were created after creating the workspace.

       If this item is selected, all other checkboxes in Item to Copy section will be unavailable. Dashboards and Reports are not copied in this mode.

.. warning::

   Copying all settings may take a long time.

-  Data Connectors :red:`*`

       allows user to copy specific connectors from Source tenant to Destination tenants.

       If user selects this item, an additional panel will be displayed in the workspace for selecting specific connectors.

-  Data Model

       allows user to copy data model configuration.

       If user selects this item, an additional panel will be displayed in the workspace for selecting specific data model items to copy.

       Roles cannot be copied from System level to tenant. This is due to the nature of system level permissions.

Edit mappings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A mapping specifies the physical destination for each database connection or schema of tenant (in case the database connection or schema name in destination is different from logical data model).

#. Select a database connection in Source.
#. Choose the mapping type: Database or Schema.
#. -  Select a schema from the Object list if using Schema mapping.
   -  For Database mapping, the Object list is already populated with the database name.
#. Select the target database connection.
#. -  Enter the schema name into the Object list if using Schema mapping.
   -  Or enter the database name into the Object list if using Database mapping.
#. Select the tenants to apply this mapping to.
#. Continue to add mappings to cover all selected database connections, schemas and tenants.

- Tenants without a Database mapping will be copied to the same database connection.
- Each schema without mapping will be copied to a schema with the same name (in the database connection specified in mapping).

For example, user needs to copy data model for schema dbo to three tenants Target01, Target02 and Target03.

Target01 and Target02 share the same physical database Northwind while Target03 uses ACMEDB database on a separate server.

Following is how to configure the workspace:

#. Tick the Data Model check-box in Items to Copy section.
#. Tick dbo schema to include in the copy task.
#. Select Target01, Target02 and Target03 as Destinations.
#. Add mappings as follows

Validate Consistency between Source and Destinations
----------------------------------------------------

#. Click Validate button at the top to validate for tenants with status "Need validated":

       Each tenant will be checked for a valid mapping for each schema.

#. Click the gear icon (âš™) next to each tenant to open Advanced Settings page for that tenant.
#. Click Validate button at the top to validate consistency in data model between source and the selected tenant.

       Selected objects in source will be checked for existence in data model for selected tenant by name.

#. Click OK to close the page.

Refresh a Workspace
-------------------

User can refresh a workspace to see the changes that appeared in Source tenant after the current workspace was created.

#. Click Refresh button to refresh the current workspace.
#. Check exsiting ones and select new items to copy if needed.
#. Click Save to save the workspace. |br|

Scheduler Configuration
-----------------------

#. .. _Workspace_Scheduler_Configuration:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/Workspace_Scheduler_Configuration.png
      :align: right
      :width: 450px

      Workspace Scheduler Configuration

   Click Schedule button at the top to open the schedule properties.
#. Configure schedule properties to run copy on a monthly, weekly, daily or hourly basis.
#. Click OK to close the dialog.

All changes in Data Model will be automatically overwritten when the workspace is started by the scheduler.

Using the Scheduler, user can distribute changes made in one Source tenant to Destination tenants by schedule. In this way, a model of tenant templates is implemented, in which one of the tenants acts as a template for other tenants. |br|
