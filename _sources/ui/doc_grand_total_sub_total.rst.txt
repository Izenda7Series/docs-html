Grand Total and Sub Total
=========================

Grand Total
=============

In report tables, the Grand Total for a field will provide either the sum (average, maximum, minimun) of all values or count (count distinct) values within that field across the entire data source.

For example, in a report for Northwind database's Orders table, the Grand Total for Freight field will tell the sum of all Freight costs until now.

Sub Total
=============

In report tables, the Sub Total for a field will provide either the sum (average, maximum, minimun) of all values or count (count distinct) values within that field for each seperated group without having any sub-report.

For example, in a report for Northwind database's Orders table, to have the sum for all Freight costs to each country without having to create additional reports, Sub Total can be used.
