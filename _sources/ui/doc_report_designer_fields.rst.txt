.. commented_out

   .. warning::

      Please write the whole expression in a single line. New line characters such as Enter will break the syntax.

Sample expressions:

   .. code-block:: sql

      Case when ([northwind].[dbo].[Orders].[EmployeeID] = 1) then 'less' when ([northwind].[dbo].[Orders].[EmployeeID] = 3 ) then 'mid' when ([northwind].[dbo].[Orders].[EmployeeID] = 4)  then 'high' else 'not evaluated' end

      Case when (BETWEEN([northwind].[dbo].[Orders].[EmployeeID], 1,3)) then 'less' when (BETWEEN([northwind].[dbo].[Orders].[EmployeeID], 4,6) ) then 'mid' when ( BETWEEN([northwind].[dbo].[Orders].[EmployeeID], 7,10))  then 'high' else 'not evaluated' end

      IF ([northwind].[dbo].[Orders].[EmployeeID] < 3) then 'Less' else ( IF (BETWEEN ([northwind].[dbo].[Orders].[EmployeeID] , 3, 6)) then  'More' else 'Most' END) END

.. seealso::

   -  :doc:`doc_available_calculated_field_expressions`   
  
   
.. warning::

      Calculated fields have a limitation for nesting up to 6 levels. Please see the example below: |br|
	  
      Calculated Field [One] = [Retail].[dbo].[Orders].[OrderID] * 2 |br|
      Calculated Field [Two] = [One] * 2 |br|
      Calculated Field [Three] = [Two] * 2 |br|
      Calculated Field [Four] = [Three] * 2 |br|
      Calculated Field [Five] = [Four] * 2 |br|
      Calculated Field [Six] = [Five] * 2 |br|
	  
      If the user tries to create Calculated Field [Seven] as [Six] * 2 the system will show an error that the nesting is too deep.

Add a report filter
===================

From the data sources, user can add report filters to select only the
rows that they need.

For example with Northwind database, to do a report on customers that
are in Atlanta city:

#. .. _Report_Designer_Filter_Properties:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/Report_Designer_Filter_Properties.png
      :align: right
      :width: 265px

      Report Designer - Filter Properties

   User should have selected "Customers" table in Data Source page.
#. Click Fields in the left menu.
#. Expand Filter section if needed by clicking the **>** icon.
#. Click on Selected Data Source in Middle Panel to expand the list.
#. Click on "Customers" data source to expand its fields.
#. Either drag the field "City" into the Filter box or click Add Filter
   button and select "City" in the drop-down.
#. Click on the filter area outside of the drop-down (in darker color)
   to expand the Filter Properties box. (:numref:`Report_Designer_Filter_Click_to_Select`)

   .. _Report_Designer_Filter_Click_to_Select:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/Report_Designer_Filter_Click_to_Select.png
      :width: 324px

      Report Designer - Click to Select Filter

#. The properties are listed in Filter Properties box in 3 sections (:numref:`Report_Designer_Filter_Properties`):

   -  Source
   -  Filter Settings
   -  Filter Formatting |br|

#. Select Equivalence in Filter Operator drop-down in Filter Settings
   section.
#. Select Equals (Manual Entry) in the next drop-down.
#. Type in "Atlanta".

.. note::

   Any field marked as not filterable in Data Model cannot be used in a filter. It can neither be dragged into the Filter box, nor appear in a filter drop-down.

.. note::

   In case data source is a stored procedure, its parameters are automatically added as report filters.

      :width: 719px

      Report Designer - Filters from Parameters

Configure filter properties in Filter Settings section
======================================================

In this section, user can:

-  Choose a filter
   alias.

       This alias will be the display text on report at runtime, if
       visible.
       The alias must be unique inside the whole report. Any duplicated
       value will result in an error message (:numref:`Report_Designer_Duplicated_Filter_Alias`).
       The alias can contain any characters except for "[" and "]".

       .. _Report_Designer_Duplicated_Filter_Alias:

       .. figure:: /_static/images/Report_Designer_Duplicated_Filter_Alias.png
          :width: 515px

          Report Designer - Duplicated Filter Alias

-  Select the filter to be visible or not at runtime.

       A filter with a fixed condition (such as "City" always equals
       "Atlanta") should be hidden at runtime.

-  Select the filter to be required or not.
       .. _Report_Designer_Required_Filter:

      A required filter will force end-user to enter filter values in
      order to run it.
      Contrary to a fixed condition, the example report above could be
      more flexible if the "City"-equals-"Atlanta" filter is visible
      and not required. Then the report still shows customers in
      Atlanta by default, but end-user can select another city or even
      empty the value to show all customers. Screenshot to be updated.

      .. note::
      
         For a stored procedure's parameter, if the Required checkbox is not selected and the filter value is empty, the stored procedure will be executed with 'null' value. If your stored procedures do not return all results when null is passed, leaving this value as null will always return no results. This is a new behavior from version 2.12.0.

-  Select the filter to be cascading or not.

       A cascading filter will constrain the available values in other
       filters behind it. For example, if a report has two filters:
       Country and City, and a value was selected for Country, then the
       only possible values that can be selected for City will be ones
       with a match for the current Country. Screenshot to be updated.

-  Choose sorting order for filter values: unsorted, ascending or
   descending by repeatedly clicking the icon.

-  Select the filter condition.

Configure filter properties in Filter Formatting section
========================================================

In this section, user can:

-  Choose a font face and font size.

-  Choose text effects bold, italic and underlined.

-  Set text color and cell color.

.. _Build_complex_filter_logic:

Build complex filter logic
==========================

In most cases, user simply adds new filters when needed, and the report
returns data that matches all of the filter conditions.

In some other cases, that simple match-all condition is not enough. For
example, user needs a report of all customers that are in Atlanta city
with either CompanyName or ContactName "John". Such "either A or B"
condition requires building a filter logic.

#. Add a filter for "City", "Equivalence", "Equals", "Atlanta" (see `Add
   a report filter`_).
#. Similarly, add a filter for "CompanyName", "String", "Like", "John".
#. Similarly, add a filter for "ContactName", "String", "Like", "John".
#. The filters are subsequently numbered 1, 2 and 3 in the filter box.
#. Enter the logic into Filter Logic box. The following rule of thumb
   may help:
#. For each "either A or B" condition, write an "or" condition using the
   filter numbers, and wrap it in parentheses - ``(2 OR 3)`` for this
   example.
#. Fill in other "and" conditions using the filter numbers -
   ``1 AND (2 OR 3)`` for this example.
#. Click Validate Syntax button to check the logic.

.. _Apply_Cross_Filtering_to_Multiple_Report_Parts:

Apply Cross Filtering to Multiple Report Parts
=========================================================

.. versionadded:: 2.1.0

Cross filtering allows user to drill up and drill down data in multiple :term:`report parts <report part>` together. For each drilling action from user, it will filter related report parts automatically. Cross filtering is initalized on charts, gauges, or maps which have more than one x-axis field as the drill down feature of these items is what triggers the cross fitlering functionality for all other report parts. 

.. _Report_Designer_Filter_Cross_Filtering_Sample:

.. figure:: /_static/images/Report_Filtering/Report_Cross_Filtering_ShipCountry_ShipCity_by_Germany.png
   :width: 810px

   Cross Filtering Sample - User drilled down to "Germany" in the Chart, and the Grid is automatically filtered by "Germany" only.

#. Select related report parts to apply cross filtering. In this example Chart and Grid will be drilled up and down together while Map remains independent.

===================

There are many ways to
display data in a report: bar chart, line chart, pie chart, map, data
grid, etc, each is supported by a different :term:`report part`. Built-in report
parts include:

-  Chart (Bar Chart, Line Chart, Pie Chart, etc.)
-  Form
-  Grid (Horizontal, Vertical, Pivot)
-  Gauge
-  Map

Any new report will include one default blank report part. Additional
report parts of the same or different types can be added by:

-  clicking Add Report Part button at the top.
-  clicking the add icon (+) in any available background cell. (:numref:`Report_Designer_Add_Report_Part`)

-  Set Grand Total and Sub Total.

.. topic:: Grand Total and Sub Total

   In report tables, the Grand Total for a field will provide the sum of all values within that field across the entire table. For example, in a report for Northwind database's Orders table, the Grand Total for Freight field will tell the sum of all Freight costs until now. Screenshot to be updated.

   To have the sum for all Freight costs to each country without having to create additional reports, Grouping and Sub Total can be used. Grouping will group data for each ShipCountry together, while Sub Total for Freight field will give the sum of all Freight costs in each country/group. Screenshot to be updated.

   Grand Total and Sub Total is not necessarily the sum calculation. Other functions include minimum, maximum, average, count and user-defined expression.

   For more detail about Grand Total and Sub Total please read :doc:`doc_grand_total_sub_total`.
