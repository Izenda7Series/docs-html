**Some advanced permissions**:

-  Reports > Data Sources

       Select Simple Data Sources to restrict tenants to using only data
       sources already having relationships with each other.

       data sources then build relationships by themselves.

-  Reports > Report Categories/Subcategories > Category Accessibility
   and Dashboards > Dashboard Categories/Subcategories > Category
   Accessibility

       tenants see it (and its child reports/dashboards) in Report
       List/Dashboard List.
       Move a category/subcategory from Visible to Saving to further
       allow tenants to save/move/copy reports/dashboards into it.

-  Access > Access Limits

       Move a role/user from Available to Allowed to share will enable
       tenants to share reports/dashboards with that role/user.

-  Access > Access Default

       Add sharings here similar to :doc:`doc_report_designer_access` to be used as
       default sharings for any newly-created report/dashboard.

       Move a role/user from Available to Allowed to share will enable
       tenants to set up schedule deliveries to send to this role/user.
